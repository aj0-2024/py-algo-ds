"""
Notes:
    - One of the most elegant ways to solve connection problems.
    - Two parts - union & find.
    - Path compression and weighting can improve performance.
    - Uses the union find datastructure.

Applications:
    - Track and merge disjoint sets.
    - Prolog unification.
    - Percolation Problem.

ToDo:
    - Implementation
    - Tests
