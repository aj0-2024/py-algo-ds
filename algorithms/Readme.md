# Algorithms
In simplest terms, algorithms are sequences of steps to solve a given problem

## Classicification
1. Greedy algorithms
2. Dynamic Programming
    2.1 Memoization
    2.2 Bottom-up

## Recursion
Recursion is a computation concept where a function calls itself until a base case is reached. It can provide an elegant solution to some of the most complex problems in computer science.

**Tail end recursion is a better approach**

### TO DO
- Write a recursive function to get the sum within a list
- Write a recursive function to count number of items within a list
- Write a recursive function to find the maximum number in a list
- Implement Binary search algorithm using recursion
