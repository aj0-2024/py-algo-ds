#### Notes
- Dynamic programming is all about incrementally building the final answer by starting from the bottom
or the base case to the answer. We also store values in memory to avoid recomputation.
- Often slower, a faster but less accurate algorithm may exist.
- Always depends on a formula to calculate curr value based on previous values. If you have the 
formula, you can write the code for it.
- In some cases, sliding window approach might lead to an optimized algorithm.
- To reduce space, figure out ways to keep only the required values as you go.
- In some cases, A greedy approach can provide an optimized solution. But make sure it works by
going through several test cases.

#### Approach
- Start with a table with a range of expected output and input (or) if comparing two items, have
each item build gradually in row and column. In some cases your table is flat 1D.
- Get the base case (string - empty etc)
- Dynamic programming works by starting and incrementally solving the problem from the base case.
(Bottom up programming).
- Now write out the output for each cell and figure out the formula. Usually invovles maxes, mins 
and curr value.
- Once you have the formula it should be straight forward to implement code.
- If you need to back track, save pointers and values along with output so far in your table.

#### Notes
- Base case
- Start from minimum
- What to do at each step? how do we update?

| # | Problem | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Valid IP addresses from a string | Looping based on groups of 4 |
| 2 | Four Number Sum | Two inner loops ...i and i... which do different things |

## Tips

### While loops
- Check for out of bound errors within the loop.
- Check for early termination.
- There should be an update every loop - no updates in a particular loop will lead to an infinite loop.

### BFS & DFS
- do not use .pop() too early, only when it makes sense.

## TO-DO
- Implement the tree traversals (recursive & iterative in a separate file)
- Finish `Find rotation point`
