# Linked List

## General Notes

1. Value can be anything - string, char, numbers etc
2. The list can be **sorted** or **unsorted**
3. Duplicates may exist
4. The list has an order starting from head and ends at tail
5. Values are not accessible by index

## Advantages

1. Insertions and deletions at beginning are faster than array.
    - Insertions and deletions at the end can be made faster by using a tail pointer
    within the linked list.

## Disadvantages

1. Insertions and deletions in the middle of the array is expensive
2. Requires more memory compared to arrays

## TODO

1. Use Iterator patterns to loop through the linked list
    - Raise an exception when loop exists (Important)
